# Google Cloud Platform Fundamentals: Core Infrastructure

## Week 1 

### GCP offers four main kinds of services: 
- compute
- storage 
- big data
- ml

& networking 

### What is cloud computing? 
- On-demand self-service: no human intervention needed to get resources
- Broad network access: access from anywhere
- Resouce pooling: provider shares resources to customers
- Rapid elasticity: get more resources quickly as needed
- Measured service: pay only for what you consume

### How did we get here? 
History: 
Collocation -> Vitualized -> Serverless(Fully automated)

container 

### Every company is a data company 

### GCP computing architectures

### The Google network 
highest possible throughput & lowest possible latency 

### GCP regions and zones 
zone: deployment area

Think of zone as single failure domain in a region

fault tolerance, you can spread multi region
